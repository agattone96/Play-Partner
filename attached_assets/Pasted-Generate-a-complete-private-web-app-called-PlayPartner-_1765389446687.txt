Generate a complete private web app called PlayPartner that replaces a multi-table partner management workbook with a fast, easy-to-view, easy-to-upkeep system.

Platform constraints:

Treat this as a production-ready MVP, not a mock.

If you support stack selection, use:

Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind

Supabase (Auth + Postgres + Storage + RLS)

If you do not support explicit stack selection, generate an equivalent architecture and ensure full code export is available.

Primary goals:

Low upkeep: adding/updating records must feel effortless.

Fast decisions: status, risk, feasibility, and ratings must be visible in seconds.

Modular data separation: profiles and assessments must not contaminate each other.

Privacy-first UX: sensitive details must be protected by default.

Non-negotiable logic

Create computed fields or DB views:

avg_rating
Average of all assessment ratings per Partner.

latest_admin_status
Latest status per admin per Partner.

effective_status rule

If any assessment has Blacklisted = true OR any latest admin status is Do Not Engage
→ effective_status = Do Not Engage

Else prefer Allison’s latest status if present, else Roxanne’s, else Partner.Status.

risk_flag

True if Blacklisted OR tags in Risk group.

conflict_flag

True if latest admin statuses disagree.
